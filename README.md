XBOX ONE Controller Support for SATISFACTORY

AntiMicro profile for XBOX_One Controller

Sastisfactory has many functionalities for the player and makes it very difficult to use a gamepad. It has already some connexions to the XBOX-ONE controller (Windows 10), which you cannot over-pass them.

This micro-project is with respect to the developers of SATISFACTORY and their amazing game. I hope they will make the game with full controller support soon.

Just leaving a hyperlink to the Antimicro software.

I tried to make as simple as I could for my personal gaming experience, and i decided that maybe someone else out there want to play this game with a controller. So, anyone would like try, just download the profile. I created also a .png info photo. Any suggestions, bugs, and honest feedback will be appreciated. Have fun with!

INSTUSTRUCTIONS

    Install Antimicro software (link above)
    Download the profile and the .png info
    Start Antimicro with admin rights (just to be sure)
    Load the profile .amgp
    Don't forget to start at the first set in the profile (RUN) or the third (WALK)
    You must make 2 changes in the game controls. I wrote them in the .png file
    Have fun!
